# Data-Structures-Final-Project
Code for CSCI 2270: Data Structures' Final Project  
Can be compiled by running compile.sh, if you use compile.sh use ./a to execute  
The program will automatically make certain files and append them the more you run the code.  
Matlab code is used to visualize the results but all graphs are .png files in the repository as well.  
.jpg files are not matlab related and any reasonable person should ignore them.
